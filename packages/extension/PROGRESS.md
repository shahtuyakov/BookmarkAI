# BookmarkAI Web Clip Extension - Progress Report

**Project:** BookmarkAI Web Clip Browser Extension  
**Architecture Decision Record:** ADR-009  
**Last Updated:** January 30, 2025  
**Status:** Feature Complete (MVP Ready)

## Executive Summary

The BookmarkAI Web Clip extension has been successfully developed as a Manifest V3 browser extension with React/TypeScript, featuring direct JWT authentication, a floating action button with Shadow DOM implementation, comprehensive error handling, and full integration with the BookmarkAI API gateway.

## ✅ Completed Work

### Phase 0: Initial Planning & ADR Analysis
- ✅ Analyzed ADR-009 requirements and established core architecture
- ✅ Defined multi-phase implementation plan
- ✅ Selected tech stack: Manifest V3, React, TypeScript, Vite, Chakra UI

### Phase 1: Project Foundation & Architecture
- ✅ Created extension directory structure at `packages/extension`
- ✅ Configured build tooling:
  - Vite for bundling with multi-entry points
  - TypeScript configuration
  - ESLint and Prettier setup
  - Environment variable management (.env files)
- ✅ Created Manifest V3 configuration with proper permissions
- ✅ Set up core file structure:
  - Service worker (background script)
  - Popup UI (React app)
  - Content script placeholder
  - HTML entry points
- ✅ Resolved build issues and TypeScript errors
- ✅ Added extension-specific scripts to root package.json

### Phase 2: Authentication System
- ✅ **Pivoted from OAuth to Direct Login** (major architectural change)
- ✅ Implemented JWT-based authentication:
  - AuthService singleton with login/logout/refresh token logic
  - Secure token storage using browser.storage API
  - Automatic token refresh mechanism
- ✅ Created authentication UI:
  - LoginForm component with email/password fields
  - Integrated into popup with toggle between direct login and web app login
- ✅ Service worker authentication handlers:
  - AUTH_DIRECT_LOGIN for credential-based login
  - AUTH_GET_STATE for state synchronization
  - AUTH_LOGOUT for session termination
- ✅ Fixed API endpoint configuration (resolved double `/api/v1` issue)

### Phase 5: Popup UI (Partial Implementation)
- ✅ Basic popup interface with authentication state management
- ✅ User profile display when authenticated
- ✅ Recent bookmarks/shares listing functionality
- ✅ Integration with shares API (`GET /api/v1/shares`)
- ✅ Direct login form integration with proper error handling
- ✅ Chakra UI styling implementation

### Infrastructure & Debugging
- ✅ Environment configuration for development and production
- ✅ Fixed numerous build and runtime issues:
  - Vite configuration for extension bundling
  - TypeScript type errors
  - Import path corrections
  - Removed obsolete OAuth callback files
- ✅ Successfully tested login flow with API gateway

## 🚧 In Progress

### Current Focus
- Testing and refining the direct login authentication flow
- Preparing for FAB (Floating Action Button) implementation

## 📋 Remaining Work

### Phase 3: Content Script & Floating Action Button ✅
- ✅ Implemented FAB in both `src/content/content.ts` and `content-bundled.ts`
- ✅ FAB positioning fixed at bottom-right corner (24px margin)
- ✅ FAB interaction states: idle → hover (scale + glow) → loading (spinner) → success (checkmark) → error (X)
- ✅ Auth check before bookmark action with user prompt
- ✅ Visual feedback for all states with smooth transitions
- ✅ **Shadow DOM Implementation** - Complete CSS isolation from host page
- ✅ Fixed positioning issues with proper CSS specificity

### Phase 4: Bookmark Creation Logic ✅
- ✅ Implemented bookmark creation API call in service worker
- ✅ Handle bookmark request from FAB and context menu
- ✅ Implemented UUID v4 idempotency key generation
- ✅ **Exponential back-off retry logic** for 5xx errors (1s, 2s, 4s delays)
- ✅ **Success toast notification** with "View in Timeline" link
- ✅ Fixed API endpoint path issues (/api/v1/shares)
- ✅ Proper error handling with user feedback

### Phase 5: Popup UI Enhancements ✅
- ✅ Direct login form integrated into popup
- ✅ User profile display when authenticated
- ✅ Recent bookmarks listing (last 10 shares)
- ✅ Enhanced error displays with proper messaging
- ✅ Loading states for all async operations
- ✅ Chakra UI styling implementation

### Phase 6: API Integration & Error Handling ✅
- ✅ All API endpoints properly integrated
- ✅ Optimized message passing between components
- ✅ **Comprehensive error logging system** (CSP, NETWORK, AUTH, GENERAL)
- ✅ CSP violation detection and logging
- ✅ Error logs stored in browser storage (last 100 errors)
- ✅ Proper handling of edge cases (network failures, auth expiry)

### Phase 7: Testing & CI/CD ✅
- ✅ **GitHub Actions workflow** (webext.yml) created
- ✅ CI pipeline: lint → type-check → test → build → package
- ✅ Multi-version Node.js testing (18.x, 20.x)
- ✅ Automated release creation on main branch
- ✅ Web-ext lint integration
- ✅ Security scanning with Snyk (optional)
- ⏳ Unit tests for AuthService (pending)
- ⏳ Integration tests (pending)
- ⏳ E2E tests with Playwright (pending)

## 🔄 Architecture Changes

### Major Pivot: OAuth to Direct Login
**Original Plan:** OAuth 2.0 PKCE flow with redirect to auth server  
**Current Implementation:** Direct JWT authentication with email/password

**Reasons for Change:**
- Simplified user experience within extension popup
- Reduced complexity of auth flow
- Better suited for extension context
- Maintains security with JWT tokens and refresh mechanism

**Impact:**
- Removed OAuth-related files (callback.ts, pkce.ts)
- Simplified auth configuration
- More straightforward implementation
- Better user experience

### January 30, 2025 Updates

**Major Implementations:**
1. **Shadow DOM for FAB** - Complete isolation from page styles
2. **Success Toast Notifications** - Professional feedback with timeline link
3. **Exponential Back-off Retry** - Robust handling of server errors
4. **CSP Error Logging** - Comprehensive debugging capabilities
5. **GitHub Actions CI/CD** - Complete automation pipeline

**Bug Fixes:**
- Fixed FAB positioning issues (removed `all: initial` CSS)
- Corrected API endpoint paths (added `/v1/` prefix)
- Fixed idempotency key to use proper UUID v4 format
- Resolved TypeScript errors in error handling

## 🎯 Remaining Tasks

### High Priority
- [ ] Extension icons (16x16, 32x32, 48x48, 128x128)
- [ ] Unit tests for AuthService and core functionality

### Medium Priority
- [ ] Integration tests for complete user flows
- [ ] Production environment configuration
- [ ] Chrome Web Store assets preparation
