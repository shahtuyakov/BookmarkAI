# BookmarkAI Web Clip Extension - Progress Report

**Project:** BookmarkAI Web Clip Browser Extension  
**Architecture Decision Record:** ADR-009  
**Date:** January 29, 2025  
**Status:** In Development

## Executive Summary

The BookmarkAI Web Clip extension is being developed as a Manifest V3 browser extension with React/TypeScript, featuring direct JWT authentication (replacing OAuth flow), a floating action button for content capture, and integration with the BookmarkAI API gateway.

## ‚úÖ Completed Work

### Phase 0: Initial Planning & ADR Analysis
- ‚úÖ Analyzed ADR-009 requirements and established core architecture
- ‚úÖ Defined multi-phase implementation plan
- ‚úÖ Selected tech stack: Manifest V3, React, TypeScript, Vite, Chakra UI

### Phase 1: Project Foundation & Architecture
- ‚úÖ Created extension directory structure at `packages/extension`
- ‚úÖ Configured build tooling:
  - Vite for bundling with multi-entry points
  - TypeScript configuration
  - ESLint and Prettier setup
  - Environment variable management (.env files)
- ‚úÖ Created Manifest V3 configuration with proper permissions
- ‚úÖ Set up core file structure:
  - Service worker (background script)
  - Popup UI (React app)
  - Content script placeholder
  - HTML entry points
- ‚úÖ Resolved build issues and TypeScript errors
- ‚úÖ Added extension-specific scripts to root package.json

### Phase 2: Authentication System
- ‚úÖ **Pivoted from OAuth to Direct Login** (major architectural change)
- ‚úÖ Implemented JWT-based authentication:
  - AuthService singleton with login/logout/refresh token logic
  - Secure token storage using browser.storage API
  - Automatic token refresh mechanism
- ‚úÖ Created authentication UI:
  - LoginForm component with email/password fields
  - Integrated into popup with toggle between direct login and web app login
- ‚úÖ Service worker authentication handlers:
  - AUTH_DIRECT_LOGIN for credential-based login
  - AUTH_GET_STATE for state synchronization
  - AUTH_LOGOUT for session termination
- ‚úÖ Fixed API endpoint configuration (resolved double `/api/v1` issue)

### Phase 5: Popup UI (Partial Implementation)
- ‚úÖ Basic popup interface with authentication state management
- ‚úÖ User profile display when authenticated
- ‚úÖ Recent bookmarks/shares listing functionality
- ‚úÖ Integration with shares API (`GET /api/v1/shares`)
- ‚úÖ Direct login form integration with proper error handling
- ‚úÖ Chakra UI styling implementation

### Infrastructure & Debugging
- ‚úÖ Environment configuration for development and production
- ‚úÖ Fixed numerous build and runtime issues:
  - Vite configuration for extension bundling
  - TypeScript type errors
  - Import path corrections
  - Removed obsolete OAuth callback files
- ‚úÖ Successfully tested login flow with API gateway

## üöß In Progress

### Current Focus
- Testing and refining the direct login authentication flow
- Preparing for FAB (Floating Action Button) implementation

## üìã Remaining Work

### Phase 3: Content Script & Floating Action Button
- [ ] Implement FAB in `src/content/content.ts`
- [ ] FAB positioning and styling
- [ ] FAB interaction states (hover, click, loading)
- [ ] Auth check before bookmark action
- [ ] Visual feedback for bookmark success/failure

### Phase 4: Bookmark Creation Logic
- [ ] Implement bookmark creation API call in service worker
- [ ] Handle bookmark request from FAB and context menu
- [ ] Implement idempotency logic (SHA-1 or UUID based)
- [ ] Error handling and retry logic
- [ ] Success notifications to user

### Phase 5: Popup UI Enhancements
- [ ] Enhanced error displays
- [ ] Loading states improvements
- [ ] Bookmark management features
- [ ] UI/UX refinements

### Phase 6: API Integration Refinement
- [ ] Finalize all API endpoints integration
- [ ] Optimize message passing between components
- [ ] Handle edge cases and error scenarios

### Phase 7: Testing & Production
- [ ] Unit tests for core services (AuthService, API calls)
- [ ] Integration tests for auth flow
- [ ] E2E tests for complete user flows
- [ ] Production build optimization
- [ ] CI/CD pipeline setup (GitHub Actions)
- [ ] Extension store preparation

## üîÑ Architecture Changes

### Major Pivot: OAuth to Direct Login
**Original Plan:** OAuth 2.0 PKCE flow with redirect to auth server  
**Current Implementation:** Direct JWT authentication with email/password

**Reasons for Change:**
- Simplified user experience within extension popup
- Reduced complexity of auth flow
- Better suited for extension context
- Maintains security with JWT tokens and refresh mechanism

**Impact:**
- Removed OAuth-related files (callback.ts, pkce.ts)
- Simplified auth configuration
- More straightforward implementation
- Better user experience

## üéØ Next Immediate Steps

1. **Complete FAB Implementation** (Phase 3)
   - Design and implement the floating action button
   - Test on various websites
   - Handle positioning edge cases

2. **Implement Bookmark Creation** (Phase 4)
   - Wire up the bookmark API call
   - Add proper error handling
   - Implement success feedback

3. **Enhance Testing**
   - Create test suite for authentication
   - Add integration tests
   - Manual testing checklist

## üìä Progress Metrics

- **Phases Completed:** 2.5 of 7 (35%)
- **Core Features Implemented:**
  - ‚úÖ Authentication system
  - ‚úÖ Basic UI
  - ‚úÖ API integration (partial)
  - ‚è≥ Content capture (FAB)
  - ‚è≥ Bookmark creation
- **Build Status:** ‚úÖ Passing
- **TypeScript Errors:** ‚úÖ Resolved
- **API Integration:** ‚úÖ Auth working, ‚è≥ Bookmarking pending

## üêõ Known Issues

1. Extension ID needs to be stable for production
2. Icon assets need proper sizing variants
3. Content Security Policy might need adjustments for some sites

## üìù Notes

- The direct login implementation is working successfully with the API gateway
- The extension correctly handles JWT tokens and refresh flow
- Recent shares display is functional when authenticated
- Build process is stable and reproducible
