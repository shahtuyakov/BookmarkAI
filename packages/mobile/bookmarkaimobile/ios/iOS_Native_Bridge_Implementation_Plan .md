iOS Native Bridge with URLSession Adapter - Implementation Plan

  Based on my analysis, the iOS URLSession adapter is already fully implemented but
  temporarily disabled. Here's the plan to complete the integration:

  Current State Summary:

  - ✅ Native Swift URLSession implementation exists
  - ✅ Objective-C bridge for React Native exists
  - ✅ TypeScript adapter wrapper exists
  - ✅ Certificate pinning support implemented
  - ❌ Currently disabled due to unresolved issues
  - ❌ Using React Native fetch adapter as fallback

  Phase 1: Diagnose & Fix Existing Issues (Week 1)

  1.1 Issue Investigation
  - Review native module logs for crash reports or errors
  - Test URLSession adapter in isolation with unit tests
  - Check for memory leaks or retain cycles in Swift code
  - Verify proper JSON serialization/deserialization
  - Test certificate pinning in production environment

  1.2 Common Issues to Check
  - Request/response body encoding (especially for non-JSON data)
  - Header formatting and case sensitivity
  - Cookie handling differences between URLSession and fetch
  - Multipart/form-data support
  - Redirect handling behavior
  - SSL/TLS configuration differences

  Phase 2: Enhanced Error Handling (Week 1-2)

  2.1 Native Side Improvements
  - Add more granular error codes and messages
  - Implement request retry logic at native level
  - Add network reachability checks
  - Improve timeout handling and configuration
  - Add request/response logging for debugging

  2.2 JavaScript Side Improvements
  - Better error mapping from native to JS errors
  - Add request ID tracking for cancellation
  - Implement request queue management
  - Add performance metrics collection

  Phase 3: Testing Strategy (Week 2)

  3.1 Unit Tests
  - Test all HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, PATCH)
  - Test various content types (JSON, form-data, binary)
  - Test error scenarios (network failures, timeouts, 4xx/5xx)
  - Test certificate pinning validation
  - Test request cancellation

  3.2 Integration Tests
  - Test with actual BookmarkAI API endpoints
  - Test token refresh flow with URLSession
  - Test offline/online transitions
  - Test concurrent requests handling
  - Test large file uploads/downloads

  3.3 Platform-Specific Tests
  - Test on different iOS versions (14+)
  - Test on various devices (iPhone, iPad)
  - Test in different network conditions (WiFi, cellular, offline)
  - Test background request handling

  Phase 4: Progressive Rollout (Week 3)

  4.1 Feature Flag Implementation
  - Add feature flag: `USE_NATIVE_URLSESSION`
  - Default to false initially
  - Allow runtime switching for testing

  4.2 Rollout Strategy
  - Enable for internal testing builds
  - Monitor crash reports and performance metrics
  - Gradual rollout: 10% → 25% → 50% → 100%
  - Keep fallback mechanism for quick rollback

  Phase 5: Performance Optimization (Week 3-4)

  5.1 Benchmarking
  - Compare URLSession vs fetch performance
  - Measure memory usage patterns
  - Track battery impact
  - Monitor network efficiency

  5.2 Optimizations
  - Implement connection pooling
  - Add request/response caching
  - Optimize data serialization
  - Implement request prioritization

  Phase 6: Documentation & Monitoring (Week 4)

  6.1 Documentation
  - Document URLSession adapter architecture
  - Create troubleshooting guide
  - Add performance tuning guidelines
  - Document known limitations

  6.2 Monitoring Setup
  - Add APM metrics for network performance
  - Track adapter usage and success rates
  - Monitor error rates by error type
  - Set up alerts for degradation

  Success Criteria:

  1. Zero crashes related to URLSession adapter
  2. Performance improvement over fetch (>20% faster)
  3. All existing SDK tests pass with URLSession
  4. Certificate pinning working in production
  5. Successful handling of all API endpoints
  6. Proper error handling and recovery
  7. No memory leaks or performance degradation

  Risk Mitigation:

  - Keep React Native fetch adapter as fallback
  - Implement circuit breaker pattern
  - Add comprehensive logging
  - Create rollback plan
  - Monitor production metrics closely
