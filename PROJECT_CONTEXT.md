## Project Overview

BookmarkAI captures social-media content (TikTok, Reddit, X) via user-initiated sharing, enriches it with AI summaries/transcripts, and resurfaces items through search, digests, and integrations.

## Current Status

- **Phase**: 1 - MVP Skeleton (33% complete)
- **Sprint**: 1 (May 10-24)
- **Recent Milestones**: 
  - ‚úÖ JWT Auth with Email Verification (Completed May 17)
  - ‚úÖ /shares endpoint implementation (Completed May 17)
  - ‚úÖ BullMQ worker setup (Completed May 17)
- **Current Milestone**: üèóÔ∏è Phase 1 - MVP Skeleton (Target: May 31)

## Phase Progress

  - ‚úÖ 0.7: Complete - Set up dev environment documentation
  - ‚úÖ 0.8: Complete - Configure ESLint/Prettier and Git hooks
  - ‚úÖ 0.9: Complete - Implement secrets handling sandbox

- **Phase 1**: üèóÔ∏è 33% complete

  - ‚úÖ 1.1: Complete - Create NestJS+Fastify project structure
  - ‚úÖ 1.2: Complete - Implement JWT auth middleware with email verification
  - ‚úÖ 1.3: Complete - Develop health check endpoint
  - ‚úÖ 1.4: Complete - Implement /shares endpoint with idempotency
  - ‚úÖ 1.5: Complete - Set up BullMQ worker
  - üèóÔ∏è 1.6: In Progress - Create React Native mobile app shell (5%)
  - ‚è±Ô∏è 1.7-1.14: Not started

- **Phase 2-7**: ‚è±Ô∏è Not started

## Current Tech Stack

- **Languages**: TypeScript (Node 20), Python 3.12
- **API Framework**: NestJS with Fastify adapter
- **Client**: React Native (mobile), Next.js 14 (web), WebExtension (planned)
- **Backend**: NestJS with Fastify, BullMQ (background processing)
- **Authentication**: JWT with AWS KMS, Refresh tokens, Email verification
- **Data**: PostgreSQL 15 + pgvector, Redis, S3
- **Infrastructure**: AWS CDK (TypeScript)
- **ORM**: Drizzle ORM
- **Email**: Ethereal (dev), AWS SES (production)

## Recent Enhancements

- **BullMQ Worker Implementation**:
  - Worker processes shares asynchronously with configurable settings
  - Status transitions from "pending" to "processing" to "done"
  - Bull Board UI for monitoring at `/api/admin/queues`
  - Comprehensive error handling and retry support
  - Designed for extensibility in Phase 2 with platform-specific processors

- **Enhanced Authentication System**:
  - Email verification flow with secure tokens
  - Password reset functionality
  - User profile management
  - Role-based access control

- **Shares API Endpoint**:
  - Implemented RESTful /shares endpoint with proper validation
  - Added platform detection (TikTok, Reddit, Twitter, X)
  - Integrated with BullMQ for background processing
  - Implemented cursor-based pagination for efficient listing
  - Added Redis-based idempotency handling with 24h TTL
  - Created comprehensive error handling system
  - Added rate limiting (10 req/10s) to prevent abuse

## High-Level Architecture

1. **User Authentication**: JWT-based auth with refresh tokens and email verification
2. **Capture Layer**: Mobile share extensions & browser extension for content saving
3. **API Gateway**: NestJS+Fastify application with modular structure
4. **Orchestration Worker**: BullMQ worker processes events, dispatches sub-tasks
5. **Python ML Workers**: Caption extraction, transcription, summarization (planned)
6. **Post-processing**: Finalizes records, marks status (planned)
7. **Inbox/Search**: Vector similarity search via pgvector (planned)
8. **Digest Service**: Weekly stats and email digests (planned)

## Current Focus

- Completing Phase 1 MVP Skeleton
- Next task: Create React Native mobile app shell (Task 1.6)
- Followed by: Implement iOS Share Extension (Task 1.7)

## Recent Decisions

- Implemented BullMQ worker with 5-second simulated processing
- Added Bull Board UI for worker monitoring and debugging
- Created a retry strategy with exponential backoff for failed jobs
- Implemented configurable settings with environment variables
- Documented architecture decisions in ADR-0004

## Known Challenges

- Ensuring proper auth integration with mobile and extension clients
- Planning microservice extraction path for ML components
- Designing effective vector search strategies for content retrieval
- Managing background job reliability with potential rate limiting from external APIs

## Next Steps

- Complete remaining tasks in Phase 1
- Set up CI/CD pipeline for automated deployment
- Begin planning for Phase 2 (Metadata + Caption Fetch)
