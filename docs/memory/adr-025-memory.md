# ADR-025 Implementation Memory

## Overview
This document captures the implementation details and decisions made while implementing ADR-025: Python ML Microservice Framework & Messaging Architecture.

## Implementation Timeline

### Phase 1: Infrastructure Setup âœ…
- **RabbitMQ Configuration**: Moved to main docker-compose.yml for centralized management
  - Created `docker/rabbitmq/rabbitmq.conf` with proper configuration
  - Fixed RabbitMQ 3.13 compatibility issues (deprecated environment variables)
  - Default user: ml/ml_password, Memory: 60%, Disk limit: 5GB

### Phase 2: Python Shared Module âœ…
- Created `/python/shared/` module with centralized Celery configuration
- Queue definitions: ml.summarize, ml.transcribe, ml.embed
- All queues configured as quorum queues for durability
- Worker settings: max-tasks-per-child=50, prefetch-multiplier=8

### Phase 3: LLM Service Implementation âœ…
- Service structure with Celery worker pattern
- Implemented OpenAI integration for summarization
- Added celery-singleton for duplicate suppression
- Database persistence to ml_results table
- Task signature: `summarize_content(share_id, content, options)`

### Phase 4: Node.js Integration âœ…
- Created ML Producer Service with amqplib ConfirmChannel
- Database migration 0007_ml_results_table.sql
- Added Drizzle schema for ml_results
- Proper connection management and error handling

### Phase 5: Startup Scripts âœ…
- Created Docker-based startup/shutdown scripts
- `scripts/start-ml-services.sh` and `scripts/stop-ml-services.sh`

### Phase 6: Monitoring & Observability âœ… (June 28, 2025)
- **Prometheus Metrics for ML Producer**:
  - Created MLMetricsService with comprehensive metrics
  - Tracks: connection state, task success/failure rates, publish latency, circuit breaker state
  - Endpoints: `/api/ml/metrics/prometheus` and `/api/ml/metrics/json`
- **Grafana Dashboards**:
  - ML Producer Monitoring: Connection health, task metrics, performance
  - ML Analytics: Cost tracking, task performance, transcription analytics
  - Fixed metric name mismatches (e.g., ml_cost_usd_total â†’ ml_cost_dollars_total)
  - Fixed datasource UID issues (replaced ${DS_PROMETHEUS} with actual UID)
- **Python Worker Metrics**:
  - Workers expose metrics on ports 9091-9093
  - Successfully integrated with Prometheus scraping

## Key Decisions & Learnings

### RabbitMQ Version Compatibility
- **Issue**: RabbitMQ 3.13 deprecated several environment variables
- **Solution**: Moved configuration to rabbitmq.conf file

### TypeScript/amqplib Integration
- **Issue**: Type mismatches with Connection/Channel interfaces
- **Solution**: Used ChannelModel and ConfirmChannel types for publisher confirms

### Docker Build Context
- **Issue**: Dockerfile couldn't access ../shared from llm-service context
- **Solution**: Set context to ../python and adjusted COPY paths

### Metrics Integration
- **Issue**: Dashboards showed no data due to metric name mismatches
- **Solution**: Updated dashboard queries to match actual metric names from workers
- **Note**: Celery/Flower metrics require additional configuration for full dashboard functionality

### Storage Strategy
- **Local Development**: Using MinIO S3-compatible storage
- **Bucket**: `bookmarkai-media-development` 
- **Access**: MinIO console at http://localhost:9001
- **Future**: Will migrate to AWS S3 when account is available
