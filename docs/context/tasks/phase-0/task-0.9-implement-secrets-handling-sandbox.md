# Task Context: 0.9 - Implement secrets handling sandbox

## Basic Information

- **Phase**: 0 - Local Dev Environment
- **Owner**: DevOps
- **Status**: 100% complete
- **Started**: 2025-05-16
- **Completed**: 2025-05-17
- **Dependencies**: 0.6 (Document environment variables)
- **Dependent Tasks**: 1.1 (Create NestJS+Fastify project structure)

## Requirements

- Set up .envrc with direnv for automated environment variable loading
- Implement Vault dev server for local secrets management
- Create clear separation between configuration and secrets
- Provide utilities for working with secrets
- Document the secret management approach
- Integrate with Docker Compose environment

## Implementation Approach

- Created .envrc file for direnv to automatically load environment variables
- Implemented startup script for HashiCorp Vault development server
- Developed Node.js utility for retrieving and managing secrets
- Added Vault service to Docker Compose configuration
- Created initialization scripts for automated Vault setup
- Added documentation for the secrets management system
- Integrated with existing environment variable configuration

## Current Implementation

The secrets handling sandbox includes:

1. `.envrc` file that:

   - Loads environment variables from .env file
   - Checks for Vault availability
   - Retrieves secrets from Vault when available
   - Sets up project-specific utilities

2. Vault setup script (`scripts/setup-vault.sh`) that:

   - Sets up a Vault development server
   - Configures the KV secrets engine
   - Creates initial example secrets
   - Provides usage instructions

3. Vault utility (`scripts/vault-secrets.js`) for:

   - Listing available secrets
   - Retrieving specific secrets
   - Formatted output for easy consumption

4. Docker Compose integration:

   - Vault service with proper configuration
   - Initialization container for automated setup
   - Volume mounting for persistence

5. Comprehensive documentation in `docs/guides/secrets-management.md`

## Challenges & Decisions

- **2025-05-16**: Decided to use HashiCorp Vault instead of AWS Secrets Manager for local development due to simplicity and cross-platform support
- **2025-05-16**: Implemented strict separation between public configuration (.env) and sensitive secrets (Vault) to establish clear security boundaries
- **2025-05-17**: Added Docker container configuration with `tty: true` and `stdin_open: true` to resolve Vault container stability issues
- **2025-05-17**: Created separate initialization process for Docker to ensure reliable automation

## Questions & Notes

- Consider implementing automated secret rotation for development environments
- May need to establish guidelines for which values belong in Vault vs .env files
- Future integration with AWS Secrets Manager for production will require additional implementation
