# Task Context: 0.6 - Document Environment Variables

## Basic Information
- **Phase**: 0 - Local Dev Environment
- **Owner**: SeanT
- **Status**: 100% complete
- **Started**: 2025-05-16
- **Completed**: 2025-05-16
- **Dependencies**: 0.2 (Docker Compose configuration), 0.3 (AWS CDK infrastructure templates)
- **Dependent Tasks**: 0.7 (Set up dev environment documentation)

## Requirements
- Document all environment variables required by the BookmarkAI project
- Create a .env.example file with all required variables
- Provide clear descriptions and default values for each variable
- Include variables from all system components
- Organize variables by functional area

## Implementation Approach
- Inventoried environment variables from all system components (Docker, CDK, API, etc.)
- Categorized variables by functional area with clear section headers
- Added detailed descriptions, indicating required vs. optional status
- Provided sensible default values for local development
- Created a test script to verify environment variable loading
- Ensured compatibility with the secrets handling system (Task 0.9)

## Current Implementation
The environment variable documentation was implemented as a comprehensive `.env.example` file in the project root. The file includes:

- Infrastructure/deployment variables (AWS, CDK)
- Database configuration (PostgreSQL, Redis)
- Object storage settings (MinIO/S3)
- API and authentication configuration
- Worker system parameters
- ML service configuration
- Monitoring/observability settings
- Security and secrets management
- Development tools configuration

A test script (`test-env.js`) was also created to verify that environment variables are being loaded correctly.

## Challenges & Decisions
- **Service Discovery**: Decided to use explicit host/port configuration for services rather than relying on Docker service discovery for better portability between local and cloud environments.
- **Secret Handling**: Distinguished between variables that should be stored in Vault vs. those safe for `.env` files.
- **Default Values**: Set sensible defaults for development but included placeholder comments for production settings.
- **Documentation Style**: Used section headers and detailed comments for better readability and maintenance.

## Questions & Notes
- Consider implementing a validation system for environment variables in the future
- Environment variables for ML services may need expansion as those services are developed
- The environment configuration works with Docker Compose and will need testing with AWS deployment
