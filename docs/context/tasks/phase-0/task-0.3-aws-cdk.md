# Task 0.3: Implement AWS CDK Infrastructure Templates

## Overview
- **Owner**: SeanT
- **Status**: Complete
- **Started**: 2025-05-16
- **Completed**: 2025-05-16

## Requirements
- Implement AWS CDK infrastructure templates focused on development environment
- Design modular architecture with separate stacks
- Configure database resources (PostgreSQL + pgvector, Redis)
- Set up container orchestration (ECS Fargate)
- Prepare for ML services deployment

## Implementation Details

### Infrastructure Structure
- Database Stack: VPC, RDS PostgreSQL, ElastiCache Redis
- API Stack: ECS Fargate services for API with load balancer
- Worker Stack: Background processing services
- ML Stack: Python-based ML services and S3 bucket

### Security Approach
- VPC with public, private, and isolated subnets
- Security groups designed to avoid circular dependencies
- Principle of least privilege for IAM roles

### Development Optimizations
- Simplified resource sizing for dev environment
- Easy local to cloud transition

## Key Decisions
- Used TypeScript for CDK to maintain consistency with application code
- Designed stack boundaries to avoid circular dependencies
- Created reusable patterns for service deployment
- Implemented security best practices with proper isolation

## Challenges & Solutions
- **Circular Dependencies**: Security group references created circular dependencies between stacks
  - Solution: Pre-configured security groups in Database stack with VPC-wide access
- **Cross-Stack References**: Needed clean way to share resources
  - Solution: Shared VPC and security groups as props to dependent stacks

## Future Considerations
- Set up CI/CD pipeline for infrastructure
- Add infrastructure testing
- Create production-ready configurations
