# Task Context: 0.5 - Develop Seed Data Scripts

## Basic Information
- **Phase**: 0 - Local Dev Environment
- **Owner**: [Your Name]
- **Status**: 100% complete
- **Started**: [Start Date]
- **Completed**: [Current Date]
- **Dependencies**: 0.4 (Create database migration scripts)
- **Dependent Tasks**: 1.4 (Implement /shares endpoint)

## Requirements
- Create seed data scripts for database tables (users, shares, transcripts)
- Support CI/CD pipeline usage
- Enable individual seeding of each entity type
- Provide verification utilities
- Support multiple environments (dev, test, CI)
- Include realistic test data

## Implementation Approach
- Implemented TypeScript-based modular seed system
- Created entity-specific seed modules for users, shares, transcripts
- Added a CI/CD process manager with retry logic and error handling
- Supported multiple environments via configuration
- Integrated with GitHub Actions for automated testing
- Added comprehensive verification utilities
- Used transaction-based seeding for data consistency

## Current Implementation
The seed system consists of:

1. **Index Module** - Command-line interface with options for specific seed types
2. **Entity Modules** - Separate modules for users, shares, transcripts, and embeddings
3. **CI Process** - Comprehensive CI seeding with performance metrics
4. **Environment Support** - Configuration for different environments
5. **Verification** - Tools to verify successful seeding

The scripts can be run via npm:
```bash
npm run seed:all         # Seed all entities
npm run seed:users       # Seed only users
npm run seed:ci          # Run CI process
npm run seed:verify      # Verify data
```

## Challenges & Decisions
- **Database UUID Handling**: Used explicit casting to text when using LIKE operator with UUIDs.
- **Environment Configuration**: Created a `ci-local` environment for better local testing.
- **Transaction Management**: Used SQL transactions to ensure consistency and rollback on errors.
- **Schema Compatibility**: Updated seed data structure to match actual database schema.
- **CI/CD Integration**: Designed retry logic and proper error reporting for CI environments.

## Questions & Notes
- Consider expanding seed data with more realistic content for ML tasks
- The embedding generation uses Redis queue - ensure worker services are running for complete testing
- For large datasets, consider adding pagination or chunking to the seed process
