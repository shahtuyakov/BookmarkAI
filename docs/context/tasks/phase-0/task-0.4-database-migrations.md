# Task Context: 0.4 - Create Database Migration Scripts

## Basic Information
- **Phase**: 0 - Local Dev Environment
- **Owner**: SeanT
- **Status**: 100% complete
- **Started**: 2025-05-17
- **Completed**: 2025-05-17
- **Dependencies**: 0.2 (Docker Compose configuration)
- **Dependent Tasks**: 0.5 (Develop seed data scripts), 1.4 (Implement /shares endpoint)

## Requirements
- Set up database migration scripts for PostgreSQL
- Enable and configure pgvector extension
- Create schema for users, shares, metadata, transcripts, and embeddings
- Set up HNSW index for vector similarity search
- Ensure migration scripts can be run in local development environment

## Implementation Approach
- Used Drizzle ORM for schema definition and migrations
- Created customType for vector column to support pgvector
- Implemented a migration runner script with extension setup
- Added custom SQL for HNSW index creation
- Structured tables according to future task requirements

## Current Implementation
- Created schema files for 5 core tables in `src/db/schema/`
- Set up migration generator and runner
- Created custom migration for HNSW index setup
- Integrated with Docker PostgreSQL instance

## Challenges & Decisions
- 2025-05-17: Selected Drizzle ORM over TypeORM for its more modern TypeScript-first approach
- 2025-05-17: Used customType for vector columns instead of raw SQL to better integrate with Drizzle
- 2025-05-17: Created post-migration step for HNSW index creation since Drizzle doesn't directly support pgvector indexing

## Questions & Notes
- Embeddings table uses 1536 dimensions which is compatible with OpenAI embeddings
- HNSW index parameters (ef_construction=128, m=16) chosen based on benchmarks for similar datasets
- Vector similarity search uses cosine similarity for embeddings
