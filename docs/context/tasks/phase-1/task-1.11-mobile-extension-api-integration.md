## Challenges & Decisions

### **June 3-4, 2025**: SDK Foundation & Core Architecture
- **Challenge**: Browser extension ES module limitations with Manifest V3 service workers

### **June 7, 2025**: Authentication & Response Structure
- **Challenge**: API response structure mismatch between expected `{data: {...}}` and actual `{data: {data: {...}}}`
- **Decision**: Implemented flexible response parsing in SDK: `const data = response.data.data || response.data`
- **Result**: Robust API compatibility with graceful handling of different response formats

### **June 8, 2025**: Queue Storage Schema Alignment
