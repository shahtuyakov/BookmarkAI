# Task 1.3: Develop Health Check Endpoint

## Overview
- **Owner**: Backend Team
- **Status**: Completed
- **Started**: 2025-05-17
- **Completed**: 2025-05-17
- **Dependencies**: 1.1 (Create NestJS+Fastify project structure)

## Requirements
- Implement health check endpoint for API gateway
- Include database connectivity checks
- Include Redis connectivity checks
- Return appropriate HTTP status codes based on health state

## Implementation Details

### Endpoint Information
- **Path**: `GET /api/health`
- **Authentication**: Public (no auth required)
- **Response Status Codes**:
  - `200 OK`: All systems operational
  - `503 Service Unavailable`: One or more systems down

### Health Check Components
The endpoint checks the following components:
1. **Database**: PostgreSQL connectivity via DrizzleService
2. **Redis**: Redis connectivity via ioredis

### Response Format
```json
{
  "status": "healthy|unhealthy",
  "timestamp": "ISO-8601 timestamp",
  "version": "API version",
  "uptime": "server uptime in seconds",
  "checks": {
    "database": {
      "status": "up|down",
      "responseTime": "time in ms",
      "error": "error message (if down)"
    },
    "redis": {
      "status": "up|down",
      "responseTime": "time in ms",
      "error": "error message (if down)"
    }
  }
}
```

### Technical Implementation
- Created `HealthController` in `packages/api-gateway/src/modules/health/controllers/health.controller.ts`
- Used `@Public()` decorator to make the endpoint accessible without authentication
- Added Redis client with short connection timeout specifically for health checks
- Implemented parallel checking of all services for faster response
- Added performance measurements for each service check
- Used appropriate HTTP status codes for different health states

## Testing
The endpoint can be tested using the included `test-health.js` script:
```bash
cd packages/api-gateway
node test-health.js
```

Or using curl:
```bash
curl -v http://localhost:3001/api/health
```

## Key Benefits
1. **Monitoring Readiness**: Enables infrastructure monitoring systems to track API health
2. **Load Balancer Integration**: Can be used by load balancers to determine instance health
3. **Dependency Visibility**: Provides clear view of all dependent service statuses
4. **Performance Tracking**: Includes response times for monitoring performance issues
5. **DevOps Friendliness**: Standard endpoint format works with Kubernetes, ELB, etc.

## Future Improvements
1. Add more detailed component checks (e.g., DB query performance)
2. Add memory usage and other system metrics
3. Implement optional detailed mode with more extensive diagnostics
4. Add disk space monitoring for file storage components
5. Consider implementing custom health checks for specific business logic
