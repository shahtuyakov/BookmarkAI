# Task 1.5: Set up BullMQ Worker

## Overview
- **Owner**: Backend Team
- **Status**: Completed
- **Started**: 2025-05-17
- **Completed**: 2025-05-17
- **Dependencies**: 1.4 (Implement /shares endpoint)

## Requirements
- Set up BullMQ worker for background processing of shared content
- Log the URL being processed (echo functionality)
- Transition the share's `status` from **processing → done**
- Provide a foundation for Phase 2 content fetching and processing

## Implementation Details

### Key Components

1. **ShareProcessor Class**
   - Handles `share.process` queue jobs
   - Updates share status in database
   - Includes simulated processing delay
   - Provides extensibility hooks for Phase 2

2. **Queue Configuration**
   - Redis-backed queue with configurable settings
   - Exponential backoff retry strategy
   - Automatic job cleanup for completed/failed jobs
   - Concurrent processing (3 jobs simultaneously)

3. **Bull Board UI**
   - Administrative interface for queue monitoring
   - Basic authentication protection
   - Real-time job status visualization
   - Job inspection and management

4. **Error Handling**
   - Input validation prevents invalid URLs
   - Database failures handled appropriately
   - Timeout protection for long-running jobs
   - Failed job retention for debugging

### Configuration

The implementation is configurable via environment variables:

```
# Worker configuration
WORKER_DELAY_MS=5000
WORKER_TIMEOUT_MS=30000
WORKER_CONCURRENCY=3
COMPLETED_JOB_TTL_SECONDS=86400
FAILED_JOB_TTL_SECONDS=604800

# Admin panel security
SECURE_ADMIN=true
ADMIN_USERNAME=admin
ADMIN_PASSWORD=admin123

# Redis configuration
REDIS_HOST=localhost
REDIS_PORT=6379
```

## Testing

The implementation has been tested and verified:

1. **Basic Processing**: 
   - Share creation successfully enqueues jobs
   - Status transitions correctly: pending → processing → done
   - Processing time matches configured delay

2. **Parallel Processing**:
   - Successfully handles multiple simultaneous jobs
   - Correctly maintains concurrency limits
   - All jobs complete with proper status updates

3. **Error Handling**:
   - Properly validates input URLs before processing
   - Maintains error state for failed processing
   - Provides appropriate error messages

4. **Monitoring**:
   - Bull Board UI accessible at `/api/admin/queues`
   - Shows all queue metrics and job details
   - Allows inspection of completed, failed, and active jobs

## Future Expansion

The implementation is structured for Phase 2 expansion:

1. **Platform-Specific Processing**:
   - Placeholder method for platform handlers
   - Will support different content types (TikTok, Reddit, etc.)

2. **Enhanced Monitoring**:
   - Foundation for Prometheus metrics
   - Structure for more detailed logging

3. **Rate Limiting**:
   - Configurable per-platform settings
   - Protection against API rate limits

## Conclusion

The BullMQ worker implementation successfully meets all requirements while providing a solid foundation for Phase 2 development. The worker handles jobs reliably, provides good visibility through Bull Board, and follows the architecture decisions outlined in ADR-005.
