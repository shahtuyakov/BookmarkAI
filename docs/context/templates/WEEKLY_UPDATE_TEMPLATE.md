# SAMPLE FILLED WEEKLY UPDATE

# Weekly Update: Week 1 (May 10-17, 2025)

## Executive Summary
Completed the initial development environment setup and began Phase 1 implementation. Made good progress on API foundation and share extension integration.

## Phase Progress
- **Phase 0**: ✅ 100% Complete
- **Phase 1**: 🏗️ 35% Complete
- **Phase 2-7**: ⏱️ Not Started

## Completed This Week
- ✅ **0.8**: Configured ESLint/Prettier with Git hooks for consistent code style
- ✅ **0.9**: Implemented secrets handling with direnv and Vault dev server
- ✅ **1.1**: Created NestJS+Fastify project structure with modular architecture
- ✅ **1.2**: Implemented JWT auth middleware with KMS integration
- ✅ **1.3**: Developed health check endpoint with comprehensive service checks

## In Progress
- 🏗️ **1.4** (70%): Implementing /shares endpoint with database integration
- 🏗️ **1.5** (40%): Setting up BullMQ worker infrastructure
- 🏗️ **1.6** (30%): Creating React Native mobile app shell with navigation

## Planned Next Week
- ⏱️ **1.7**: Implement iOS Share Extension
- ⏱️ **1.8**: Implement Android Intent Filter
- ⏱️ **1.9**: Create browser WebExtension
- ⏱️ **1.10**: Set up ngrok for local testing

## Key Decisions & Changes
- Switched rate limiting implementation to use Redis-backed storage instead of in-memory for better resilience
- Adopted a more modular approach for content fetchers to allow independent scaling
- Created shared TypeScript interfaces for consistent type usage across packages

## Challenges & Risks
- **iOS Share Extension Size**: Apple's 50MB limit for share extensions may be challenging with React Native bridge - researching optimization options
- **API Rate Limits**: Initial testing shows TikTok API more restrictive than anticipated - may need to adjust crawler behavior
- **GPU Configuration**: Local development with GPU acceleration for Whisper proving complex - considering cloud-based alternative for dev

## Notes & Observations
- Team velocity is good with current parallel workstreams
- Documentation approach with task references working well for maintaining context
- Current architecture holding up well against initial scalability projections
