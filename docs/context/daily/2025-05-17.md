## Summary
Completed Task 0.4: Created database migration scripts for BookmarkAI, including pgvector extension setup and HNSW indexing.

## Tasks Worked On

### 0.4 - Create database migration scripts
- **Progress**: 100% complete
- **Today's accomplishments**:
  - Set up Drizzle ORM for database schema definition and migrations
  - Created schema files for all required tables (users, shares, metadata, transcripts, embeddings)
  - Implemented pgvector integration with custom type for vector columns
  - Created HNSW index for efficient vector similarity search
  - Set up migration runner with proper extension initialization
  - Successfully tested migrations against local Docker environment
- **Challenges encountered**:
  - Resolved issues with Drizzle ORM schema definition for vector columns
  - Adapted to newer Drizzle Kit API requirements
  - Corrected database connection configuration for Docker environment
- **Decisions made**:
  - Used Drizzle ORM over TypeORM for better TypeScript integration
  - Created custom migration for HNSW index creation
  - Used vector dimensions of 1536 for compatibility with OpenAI embeddings
- **Next steps**:
  - Begin Task 0.5: Develop seed data scripts

## General Notes
- The Docker environment configuration was already well set up, making testing easier
- Drizzle ORM provides good TypeScript integration but requires some workarounds for pgvector
- Custom migration approach for vector indexing provides flexibility for future optimizations

## Tomorrow's Focus
- Start implementing seed data scripts for the database schema
- Create realistic test data for shares and embeddings
