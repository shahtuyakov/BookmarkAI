## Summary
Completed Task 1.2: Implemented JWT auth middleware with email verification and password reset functionality for the BookmarkAI project.

## Tasks Worked On

### 1.2 - Implement JWT Auth Middleware
- **Progress**: 100% complete
- **Today's accomplishments**:
  - Implemented KmsJwtService with local RSA fallback for development
  - Created secure authentication flow with access and refresh tokens
  - Added Redis-based token blacklisting
  - Implemented secure password hashing with Argon2id
  - Created global auth guards with public route exemptions
  - Added role-based access control
  - Implemented rate limiting for auth endpoints
  - Added email verification flow with token-based verification
  - Created password reset functionality with secure tokens
  - Implemented EmailService with local development support
  - Prepared comprehensive documentation of the auth system
- **Challenges encountered**:
  - Resolved circular dependencies in NestJS modules
  - Fixed Drizzle ORM date comparison issues
  - Adapted Express-like middleware to work with Fastify
  - Properly configured cookie handling for web clients
  - Ensured token security with proper expiration and blacklisting
- **Decisions made**:
  - Used Ethereal for local email testing to avoid actual email sending
  - Implemented token family tracking to prevent refresh token attacks
  - Added user enumeration protection in security-sensitive flows
  - Created both Bearer token and cookie-based auth for different clients
  - Added comprehensive documentation to support future development
- **Next steps**:
  - Update project context with new auth capabilities
  - Begin implementing Task 1.4: /shares endpoint
  - Consider adding account management UI in future tasks

## General Notes
- The JWT authentication with email verification provides a complete auth solution
- Separation of concerns with distinct services worked well
- The local development experience with fake emails is user-friendly
- Comprehensive documentation will help other developers

## Tomorrow's Focus
- Begin Task 1.4: Implement /shares endpoint
- Ensure proper auth integration with the new endpoint
- Test the auth system with the mobile share extension
