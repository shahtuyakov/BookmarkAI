# Dev Journal: 2025-05-18

## Summary
Today I completed two tasks: Implemented AWS CDK infrastructure templates (Task 0.3) and documented environment variables (Task 0.6) for the BookmarkAI project.

## Tasks Worked On

### 0.3 - Implement AWS CDK infrastructure templates
- **Progress**: 100% complete
- **Today's accomplishments**:
  - Set up infrastructure directory with AWS CDK in TypeScript
  - Created Database stack with PostgreSQL + pgvector and Redis
  - Implemented API stack with Fargate services and load balancer
  - Created Worker stack for background processing
  - Implemented ML stack with Python services and S3 bucket
  - Resolved circular dependency challenges between stacks
  - Created ADR documenting CDK infrastructure decisions
- **Challenges encountered**:
  - CDK circular dependencies between security groups required refactoring
  - Needed to carefully manage cross-stack references
- **Decisions made**:
  - Designed security groups to allow VPC-wide access rather than granular rules to prevent circular dependencies
  - Structured code to separate infrastructure concerns into distinct stacks
  - Used CDK's higher-level constructs for managed services
- **Next steps**:
  - Integrate CDK with CI/CD for infrastructure testing
  - Create database migration scripts (Task 0.4)
  - Document infrastructure in more detail

### 0.6 - Document Environment Variables
- **Progress**: 100% complete
- **Today's accomplishments**:
  - Conducted inventory of all environment variables across system components
  - Organized variables by functional categories (database, API, workers, etc.)
  - Created comprehensive .env.example file with detailed comments
  - Added sensible default values for local development
  - Documented both required and optional variables
  - Ensured compatibility with secrets handling from Task 0.9
  - Created test script to verify environment variable loading
- **Challenges encountered**:
  - Needed to reverse-engineer some configuration from Docker Compose setup
  - Determining which variables should use Vault vs .env files
  - Aligning variable naming across different services
- **Decisions made**:
  - Used explicit host/port configuration for better portability
  - Added section headers for better organization
  - Included clear documentation on which variables are required vs optional
  - Added default values aligned with the Docker configuration
- **Next steps**:
  - Update overall project documentation (Task 0.7)
  - Consider implementing environment variable validation

## General Notes
- AWS CDK shows promise for our infrastructure needs but requires careful planning of stack boundaries
- The VPC design with public, private, and isolated subnets provides good security isolation
- Environment variable documentation will help onboarding new team members
- The Docker environment is working well with all services properly configured

## Tomorrow's Focus
- Begin Task 0.4: Create database migration scripts
- Document infrastructure details for team reference
- Set up integration testing for infrastructure
