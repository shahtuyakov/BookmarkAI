## Summary

Started Phase 1 implementation by setting up the NestJS+Fastify project structure. Completed initial architecture planning and project organization for the API gateway.

## Tasks Worked On

### 1.1 - Create NestJS+Fastify project structure

- **Progress**: 30% complete
- **Today's accomplishments**:
  - Set up basic NestJS project in the api-gateway package
  - Configured Fastify adapter integration
  - Created initial module structure based on the domain model
  - Set up basic dependency injection framework
  - Added configuration service to integrate with Vault secrets
  - Established project architecture guidelines document
- **Challenges encountered**:
  - NestJS 10 has some compatibility issues with the latest Fastify version
  - Needed to structure the project to allow for clean separation of concerns
  - Determining the right module boundaries for scalability
- **Decisions made**:
  - Using domain-driven design principles for module organization
  - Implementing repository pattern for data access
  - Created shared module for cross-cutting concerns
  - Using factory pattern for dependency injection configurations
- **Next steps**:
  - Complete module structure setup
  - Add global exception filter
  - Set up validation pipes
  - Configure logging interceptors
  - Create basic shared DTOs

## General Notes

- The secrets handling implementation from Task 0.9 is working well for local development
- Team discussion identified need for standardized error response format across APIs
- Started collecting API documentation requirements for future OpenAPI integration
- Created architecture decision record (ADR) for NestJS project structure

## Tomorrow's Focus

- Complete NestJS+Fastify project structure (Task 1.1)
- Begin implementing JWT auth middleware (Task 1.2)
- Set up team architecture review for the end of the week
