## Summary

Completed Task 1.1: Created NestJS+Fastify project structure for the BookmarkAI API gateway, implementing the modular monolith architecture defined in ADR-001.

## Tasks Worked On

### 1.1 - Create NestJS+Fastify project structure

- **Progress**: 100% complete
- **Today's accomplishments**:
  - Set up NestJS application with Fastify adapter
  - Created ConfigModule for environment variable management
  - Implemented DatabaseModule integrated with existing Drizzle ORM
  - Added basic HealthModule with database connectivity check
  - Fixed custom vector type implementation for pgvector
  - Added validation pipe and global prefix
  - Resolved TypeScript errors and port conflicts
  - Successfully tested the API health endpoint
- **Challenges encountered**:
  - TypeScript type comparison error in ConfigService
  - Custom vector type implementation needed update for Drizzle ORM v0.43.1
  - Port 3000 conflict required switching to port 3001
- **Decisions made**:
  - Selected Fastify over Express for better performance
  - Made ConfigModule and DatabaseModule global to avoid repetitive imports
  - Used dependency injection for service access
  - Created extensible health check module
- **Next steps**:
  - Implement JWT auth middleware (Task 1.2)
  - Enhance health check endpoint (Task 1.3)
  - Develop /shares endpoint (Task 1.4)

## General Notes

- The modular monolith architecture works well with NestJS's built-in module system
- Database integration with existing Drizzle ORM setup was straightforward
- The established structure provides clear separation of concerns
- Need to document module boundaries enforcement for the team

## Tomorrow's Focus

- Begin Task 1.2: Implement JWT auth middleware
- Update project documentation with architecture decisions
- Plan out shares module implementation approach
