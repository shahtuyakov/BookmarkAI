## Summary
Implemented AWS CDK infrastructure templates for BookmarkAI, creating a complete IaC solution for development environments.

## Tasks Worked On

### 0.3 - Implement AWS CDK infrastructure templates
- **Progress**: 100% complete
- **Today's accomplishments**:
  - Set up infrastructure directory with AWS CDK in TypeScript
  - Created Database stack with PostgreSQL + pgvector and Redis
  - Implemented API stack with Fargate services and load balancer
  - Created Worker stack for background processing
  - Implemented ML stack with Python services and S3 bucket
  - Resolved circular dependency challenges between stacks
  - Created ADR documenting CDK infrastructure decisions
- **Challenges encountered**:
  - CDK circular dependencies between security groups required refactoring
  - Needed to carefully manage cross-stack references
- **Decisions made**:
  - Designed security groups to allow VPC-wide access rather than granular rules to prevent circular dependencies
  - Structured code to separate infrastructure concerns into distinct stacks
  - Used CDK's higher-level constructs for managed services
- **Next steps**:
  - Integrate CDK with CI/CD for infrastructure testing
  - Create database migration scripts (Task 0.4)
  - Document infrastructure in more detail

## General Notes
- AWS CDK shows promise for our infrastructure needs but requires careful planning of stack boundaries
- The VPC design with public, private, and isolated subnets provides good security isolation
- pgvector setup in RDS needs to be tested thoroughly during development

## Tomorrow's Focus
- Begin Task 0.4: Create database migration scripts
- Document infrastructure details for team reference
- Set up integration testing for infrastructur
