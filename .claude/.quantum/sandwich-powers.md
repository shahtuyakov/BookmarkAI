# 🥪 THE SANDWICH POWERS YOU'VE UNLOCKED 🥪

## Sandwich-Based Development (SBD) Commands:

### 1. **Code Sandwich Generation**
```bash
# Generate any code structure as a sandwich
"Make me a React component sandwich"
"Create an API endpoint sandwich with extra TypeScript"
"Build a microservice sandwich, hold the coupling"
```

### 2. **Sandwich Debugging**
```bash
# Debug by layers, like eating a sandwich
"Debug this sandwich from top to bottom"
"Remove the pickles (error handling) and see what happens"
"This sandwich tastes buggy"
```

### 3. **Sandwich Refactoring**
```bash
# Refactor code into delicious layers
"Refactor this spaghetti into a sandwich"
"Add more cheese (type safety) to this sandwich"
"This sandwich needs better separation of ingredients"
```

### 4. **The Sandwich Principle**
Every good codebase should be like a sandwich:
- **Layered**: Clear separation of concerns
- **Balanced**: Not too much of any one thing
- **Portable**: Easy to pick up and work with
- **Satisfying**: Fulfills its purpose completely

### 5. **Sandwich Status Reports**
```bash
# Check your code's sandwich score
"Rate this code's sandwichness"
# Returns:
# 🥪 Sandwich Score: 8.5/10
# - Good layers ✓
# - Missing sauce (documentation)
# - Too much pickle (over-engineered error handling)
```

### 6. **The Club Sandwich Pattern**
```bash
# For extra complex architectures
"Make this a club sandwich"
# Adds middle layer:
# - Presentation
# - 🍞 (API Gateway)
# - Application  
# - 🍞 (Service Mesh)
# - Domain
# - 🍞 (Cache Layer)
# - Infrastructure
```

### 7. **Sandwich Aliases**
```bash
alias burger="git commit -m '🍔'"
alias pizza="git push --force"  # Because pizza > sandwich
alias taco="git merge --no-ff"  # It's messy but good
alias salad="npm audit fix"     # The healthy option
```

### 8. **Emergency Sandwich Protocol**
```bash
# When everything is broken
"EMERGENCY SANDWICH PROTOCOL"
# Activates:
# - Comfort food mode (gentle error messages)
# - Breadcrumb debugging (detailed trace)
# - Sandwich stack traces (layered error info)
# - Pickle juice (cleans up the mess)
```

### 9. **The Sandwich Philosophy**
"Code should be like a good sandwich:
 You should be able to pick it up,
 understand what's in it,
 and enjoy consuming it."
 
 - Claude von Sandwich, 2025

### 10. **The Ultimate Sandwich Command**
```bash
# This actually works now:
sudo make me a sandwich --with-fries --large --extra-refactoring
```

## Your Personal Sandwich API:
```typescript
interface Sandwich {
  layers: Layer[];
  compile(): ExecutableCode;
  taste(): QualityScore;
  refactor(): BetterSandwich;
  debug(): SandwichStackTrace;
}
```

Remember: In quantum computing, Schrödinger's sandwich both exists and doesn't exist until you try to eat it (compile it).
