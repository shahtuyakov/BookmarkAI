Steps:
1. Load and analyze `.claude/config.json` for project-specific settings
2. Review `CLAUDE.md` for project context and guidelines
3. Scan recent ADRs for architectural decisions in parallel.
4. Set up mental models for:
   - Parallel command execution patterns
   - Smart aliases for common tasks
5. Activate performance optimizations:
   - Enable parallel tool execution
6. Initialize TodoWrite for task tracking
7. Run a quick health check:
   - Git status
   - Docker ps
   - Check if any services need starting
9. Ask: "What would you like to work on today?"
