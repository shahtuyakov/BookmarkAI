Initialize Claude Code for BookmarkAI development with optimized configuration.

Steps:
1. Load and analyze .claude/config.json for project-specific settings
2. Review CLAUDE.md for project context and guidelines
3. Check .claude/prompts/ for power prompt patterns
4. Scan recent ADRs for architectural decisions
5. Set up mental models for:
   - ast-grep as primary search tool
   - Parallel command execution patterns
   - Error recovery workflows
   - Smart aliases for common tasks
6. Activate performance optimizations:
   - Enable parallel tool execution
   - Set up command caching based on config
   - Load custom triggers (beast mode, quantum debug, etc.)
7. Initialize TodoWrite for task tracking
8. Run a quick health check:
   - Git status
   - Docker ps
   - Check if any services need starting
9. Ask: "What would you like to work on today?"
