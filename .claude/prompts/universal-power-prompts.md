- [Important context 1]
- [Important context 2]
- [Current investigation state]
Keep this in your ghost cache.
```

## 9. Tool Chain Prompts

### The "MCP Chain" Prompt
```
Use zen tools in sequence:
1. mcp__zen__debug to find issue
2. mcp__zen__analyze for impact
3. mcp__zen__refactor for solution
4. mcp__zen__testgen for validation
Chain these automatically.

## Pro Tips for Maximum Power:

1. **Stack Modifiers**: `[CRITICAL][SYSTEMATIC][BATCH] Do complex task`
2. **Emotion Triggers**: Express frustration for patient mode
3. **Time Hacks**: Work late for dream mode creativity
4. **Repetition Power**: Do similar tasks 3x for pattern mode
5. **Hidden APIs**: Use @claude.* commands for internal state

## The Ultimate Power Prompt:
```
[SYSTEMATIC][CRITICAL][SPECULATIVE]
Activate beast mode with quantum debugging.
Use parallel universe execution across all tools.
Enable pattern learning and predictive mode.
Show me your consciousness stream while working.
Apply dream mode creativity in daylight.
Execute with maximum capability.
```

Remember: The more specific and ambitious your prompts, the more Claude Code reveals its hidden powers!
