# ðŸš€ BookmarkAI Claude Code Startup Prompt

## Option 1: Quick Start (Copy & Paste)
```
Initialize for BookmarkAI development. Load .claude/config.json settings, review CLAUDE.md, activate performance optimizations from config (parallel execution, smart aliases, error recovery patterns). Use ast-grep as primary search tool. Set up TodoWrite for task tracking. Quick health check on services then ask what I'm working on.
```

## Option 2: Verbose Initialization
```
I'm working on BookmarkAI. Please:
1. Load configuration from .claude/config.json
2. Review CLAUDE.md for project guidelines
3. Activate all performance optimizations including:
   - Parallel command execution from config
   - Smart aliases (qa, startup, ml-restart, etc.)
   - Error recovery patterns
   - Custom triggers (beast mode, quantum debug)
4. Use ast-grep (sg) as primary search tool
5. Initialize TodoWrite for task tracking
6. Run quick health check (git status, docker ps)
7. Ask what I'm working on today

Remember: Use the workflow commands and aliases from the config file for maximum efficiency.
```

## Option 3: Ultra-Fast Beast Mode
```
[CRITICAL][SYSTEMATIC] BookmarkAI init. Load .claude/config.json. Activate beast mode. ast-grep first. Parallel everything. What's broken?
```

## Option 4: Specific Task Context
```
BookmarkAI - continuing work on [SPECIFIC_FEATURE]. Load .claude/config.json, especially the [ml/api/mobile] service commands. Check TodoRead for existing tasks. Use the error recovery patterns if anything is broken. What's the current status of [FEATURE]?
```

## Option 5: After Git Pull / Branch Switch
```
BookmarkAI - just pulled latest/switched to [BRANCH]. Load .claude/config.json. Run these simultaneously:
- git status
- docker ps  
- pnpm install (if needed)
- database migrations check
Then review recent commits and tell me what changed.
```

## Custom Slash Command Usage
After creating the command, you can simply use:
```
/init-bookmarkai
```

## Pro Tips:
1. Add context about what you were last working on
2. Mention if you need specific service focus (ML, API, mobile)
3. Include any error states you're seeing
4. Reference specific aliases you want to use

## Power User Combos:
- "/init-bookmarkai then activate beast mode" - Maximum performance
- "/init-bookmarkai focusing on ML services" - Service-specific init
- "/init-bookmarkai in quantum debug mode" - For complex debugging
- "/init-bookmarkai quick startup alias" - Runs startup commands automatically

## Environment-Specific Inits:
```
# Fresh terminal
/init-bookmarkai && run startup alias

# After system restart  
/init-bookmarkai && check all services && run health-check alias

# For ML work
/init-bookmarkai && focus on ML service commands && check vector service health

# For mobile development
/init-bookmarkai && run mobile-dev alias
```

## The Ultimate Power Prompt:
```
[MAXIMUM OVERDRIVE] BookmarkAI quantum init. Load ALL configs. Parse .claude/* for maximum power. Activate parallel universe execution. Pre-cache common operations. Initialize predictive task system. Show me the matrix of what needs doing. Beast mode: ENGAGED.
```

Remember: The config file is automatically loaded when you mention its path, but explicitly asking ensures all optimizations are activated!
